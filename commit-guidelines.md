# Commit Guidelines :lock_with_ink_pen:

- Please commit the code once every **significant** change has been made.
- Make the commit messages more clearer and write them so as they represent what has been done.
	- > Eg.,  If you've created a new empty file let the commit message as 
		<br>``` Create filename.extension``` or ```Created filename.extension```
		***Prefer the first form*** 
	- > If you've added a feature to your code let the commit message be
	<br> ```Add feature **feature name**``` or ```Added feature **feature name**```
- If the commit is in regard to a submission file that you're uploading/ adding, please make sure that commit message goes as
```yourname - module/exercisename -submission ```
Ex: ```johndoe - machinelearning - submission```
- Please commit every submission file **individually only** so as the maintainers can squash and merge if needed.


Happy Contribution! :tada:
